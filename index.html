                <section>I am a very old man;</section>
             			<p class="fragment grow">how old I do not know.</p>
				<section >Possibly I am a hundred,</section>
						<p class="fragment grow">possibly more;</p> 
						<p class="fragment grow">but I cannot tell because I have never aged as other men,</p> 
						<p class="fragment grow">nor do I remember any childhood.</p> 
			<section>So far as I can recollect I have always been a man,</section>
						<p class="fragment grow">a man of about thirty.</p> 
			<section>I appear today as I did forty years and more ago, </section> 
						<p class="fragment grow">and yet I feel that I cannot go on living forever;</p>
						<p class="fragment grow">that some day I shall die the real death from which there is no resurrection.</p>
			<section>I do not know why I should fear death,</section>
 						<p class="fragment grow">I who have died twice and am still alive;</p>
						<p class="fragment grow">but yet I have the same horror of it as you who have never died,</p>
						<p class="fragment grow">but yet I have the same horror of it as you who have never died,</p>
						<p class="fragment grow">and it is because of this terror of death,</p>
						<p class="fragment grow">I believe, that I am so convinced of my mortality.</p>
 						<p class="fragment grow">I believe,</p>
						<p class="fragment grow">that I am so convinced of my mortality.</p>
  			<section>And because of this conviction I have determined to write down the story of the interesting periods of my life and of my death.</section>
						<p class="fragment grow">I cannot explain the phenomena;</p>
						<p class="fragment grow">I can only set down here in the words of an ordinary soldier of fortune a chronicle of the strange events that befell me during the   ten years that my dead body lay undiscovered in an Arizona cave.</p>
			<section>I have never told this story,</section>
						<p class="fragment grow">I have never told this story,</p>
						<p class="fragment grow">nor shall mortal man see this manuscript until after I have passed over for eternity.</p>
			<section >I know that the average human mind will not believe what it cannot grasp,</section>
						<p class="fragment grow">and so I do not purpose being pilloried by the public,</p>
						<p class="fragment grow">the pulpit,</p>
						<p class="fragment grow">and the press,</p>
						<p class="fragment grow">and held up as a colossal liar when I am but telling the simple truths which some day science will substantiate.</p>
			<section>Possibly the suggestions which I gained upon Mars,</section>
						<p class="fragment grow">and the knowledge which I can set down in this chronicle,</p>
						<p class="fragment grow">will aid in an earlier understanding of the mysteries of our sister planet;</p>
			<section>mysteries to you, but no longer mysteries to me.</section>
			<section>My name is John Carter;</section>
 						<p class="fragment grow">I am better known as Captain Jack Carter of Virginia.</p>
			<section>At the close of the Civil War I found myself possessed of several hundred thousand dollars (Confederate) and a captain's commission in the cavalry arm of an army which no longer existed;</section>
			<section>At the close of the Civil War I found myself possessed of several hundred thousand dollars (Confederate) and a captain's commission in the cavalry arm of an army which no longer existed;</section>
			<section>the servant of a state which had vanished with the hopes of the South.</section>
			<section>Masterless,</section>
			<section>penniless,</section>
			<section>penniless,</section>
			<section>and with my only means of livelihood,</section>
			<section>fighting,</section>
			<section>gone,</section>
			<section>I determined to work my way to the southwest and attempt to retrieve my fallen fortunes in a search for gold.</section>
			<section>I spent nearly a year prospecting in company with another Confederate officer, 
Captain James K. Powell of Richmond.</section>
 			<section>We were extremely fortunate, for late in the winter of 1865, after many hardships and privations, we located the most remarkable gold-bearing quartz vein that our wildest dreams had ever pictured.</section>
			<section>Powell, who was a mining engineer by education, stated that we had uncovered over a million dollars worth of ore in a trifle over three months.</section>
			<section>As our equipment was crude in the extreme we decided that one of us must return to civilization, purchase the necessary machinery and return with a sufficient force of men properly to work the mine.</section>
			<section>As Powell was familiar with the country, as well as with the mechanical requirements of mining we determined that it would be best for him to make the trip.</section>
			<section>It was agreed that I was to hold down our claim against the remote possibility of its being jumped by some wandering prospector.</section>
			<section>On March 3, 1866, Powell and I packed his provisions on two of our burros, and bidding me good-bye he mounted his horse, and started down the mountainside toward the valley, across which led the first stage of his journey.</section>
			<section>The morning of Powell's departure was, like nearly all Arizona mornings, clear and beautiful;</section>
			<section>I could see him and his little pack animals picking their way down the mountainside toward the valley, and all during the morning I would catch occasional glimpses of them as they topped a hog back or came out upon a level plateau.</section>
			<section>My last sight of Powell was about three in the afternoon as he entered the shadows of the range on the opposite side of the valley.</section>
			<section>Some half hour later I happened to glance casually across the valley and was much surprised to note three little dots in about the same place I had last seen my friend and his two pack animals.</section>
			<section>I am not given to needless worrying, but the more I tried to convince myself that all was well with Powell,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">and that the dots I had seen on his trail were antelope or wild horses,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">the less I was able to assure myself.</p>
			<section>Since we had entered the territory we had not seen a hostile Indian, and we had, therefore, become careless in the extreme, and were wont to ridicule the stories we had heard of the great numbers of these vicious marauders that were supposed to haunt the trails, taking their toll in lives and torture of every white party which fell into their merciless clutches.</section>
			<section>Powell, I knew, was well armed and, further, an experienced Indian fighter; but I too had lived and fought for years among the Sioux in the North, and I knew that his chances were small against a party of cunning trailing Apaches.</section>
			<section>Finally I could endure the suspense no longer,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">and,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">arming myself with my two Colt revolvers and a carbine,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">I strapped two belts of cartridges about me and catching my saddle horse,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">started down the trail taken by Powell in the morning.</p>
			<section>As soon as I reached comparatively level ground I urged my mount into a canter and continued this, where the going permitted, until, close upon dusk, I discovered the point where other tracks joined those of Powell.</section>
			<section>They were the tracks of unshod ponies,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">three of them,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">and the ponies had been galloping.</p>
			<section> I followed rapidly until,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">darkness shutting down,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">I was forced to await the rising of the moon,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">and given an opportunity to speculate on the question of the wisdom of my chase.</p>
			<section>Possibly I had conjured up impossible dangers,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">like some nervous old housewife,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">and when I should catch up with Powell would get a good laugh for my pains.</p>
   			<section>However,</section>	
					<p class="fragment grow">I am not prone to sensitiveness,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">and the following of a sense of duty,</p>
    				<p class="fragment grow">wherever it may lead,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow"> has always been a kind of fetich with me throughout my life;</p>
			<section>which may account for the honors bestowed upon me by three republics and the decorations and friendships of an old and powerful emperor and several lesser kings,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">in whose service my sword has been red many a time.</p>
			<section>About nine o'clock the moon was sufficiently bright for me to proceed on my way and I had no difficulty in following the trail at a fast walk,</section>	
					<p class="fragment grow">and in some places at a brisk trot until,</p>
 					<p class="fragment grow">about midnight,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">I reached the water hole where Powell had expected to camp.</p>
			<section>I came upon the spot unexpectedly,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">finding it entirely deserted,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">with no signs of having been recently occupied as a camp.</p>
			<section>I was interested to note that the tracks of the pursuing horsemen,</section>
   					<p class="fragment grow">for such I was now convinced they must be,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">continued after Powell with only a brief stop at the hole for water;</p>`
					<p class="fragment grow">and always at the same rate of speed as his.</p>
			<section>I was positive now that the trailers were Apaches and that they wished to capture Powell alive for the fiendish pleasure of the torture,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">so I urged my horse onward at a most dangerous pace,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">hoping against hope that I would catch up with the red rascals before they attacked him.</p>
    		<section>Further speculation was suddenly cut short by the faint report of two shots far ahead of me.</section>
			<section>I knew that Powell would need me now if ever,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">and I instantly urged my horse to his topmost speed up the narrow and difficult mountain trail.</p>
			<section>I had forged ahead for perhaps a mile or more without hearing further sounds,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">when the trail suddenly debouched onto a small,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">open plateau near the summit of the pass.</p>
			<section>I had passed through a narrow,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">overhanging gorge just before entering suddenly upon this table land,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">and the sight which met my eyes filled me with consternation and dismay.</p>
			<section>The little stretch of level land was white with Indian tepees,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">and there were probably half a thousand red warriors clustered around some object near the center of the camp.</p>
			<section>Their attention was so wholly riveted to this point of interest that they did not notice me,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">and I easily could have turned back into the dark recesses of the gorge and made my escape with perfect safety.</p>
			<section>The fact,</section>	
					<p class="fragment grow">however,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">that this thought did not occur to me until the following day removes any possible right to a claim to heroism to which the narration of this episode might possibly otherwise entitle me.</p>
			<section>I do not believe that I am made of the stuff which constitutes heroes,</section>
  					<p class="fragment grow">because,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">in all of the hundreds of instances that my voluntary acts have placed me face to face with death,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">I cannot recall a single one where any alternative step to that I took occurred to me until many hours later.</p>
			<section>My mind is evidently so constituted that I am subconsciously forced into the path of duty without recourse to tiresome mental processes.</section>
			<section>However that may be,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">I have never regretted that cowardice is not optional with me.</p>
			<section>In this instance I was,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">of course,</p>		
 					<p class="fragment grow">positive that Powell was the center of attraction,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">but whether I thought or acted first I do not know,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">but within an instant from the moment the scene broke upon my view I had whipped out my revolvers and was charging down upon the entire army of warriors,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">shooting rapidly,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">and whooping at the top of my lungs.</p>
			<section>Singlehanded,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">I could not have pursued better tactics,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">for the red men,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">convinced by sudden surprise that not less than a regiment of regulars was upon them,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">turned and fled in every direction for their bows,</p>	
					<p class="fragment grow">arrows,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">and rifles.</p>
			<section>The view which their hurried routing disclosed filled me with apprehension and with rage.</section>
			<section>Under the clear rays of the Arizona moon lay Powell,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">his body fairly bristling with the hostile arrows of the braves.</p>
  			<section>That he was already dead I could not but be convinced,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">and yet I would have saved his body from mutilation at the hands of the Apaches as quickly as I would have saved the man himself from death.</p>
			<section>Riding close to him I reached down from the saddle,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">and grasping his cartridge belt drew him up across the withers of my mount.</p>
			<section>A backward glance convinced me that to return by the way I had come would be more hazardous than to continue across the plateau,</section>					
					<p class="fragment grow">so,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">putting spurs to my poor beast,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">I made a dash for the opening to the pass which I could distinguish on the far side of the table land.</p>
			<section>The Indians had by this time discovered that I was alone and I was pursued with imprecations,</section>
 					<p class="fragment grow">arrows,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">and rifle balls.</p>
			<section>The fact that it is difficult to aim anything but imprecations accurately by moonlight,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">that they were upset by the sudden and unexpected manner of my advent,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">and that I was a rather rapidly moving target saved me from the various deadly projectiles of the enemy and permitted me to reach the shadows of the surrounding peaks before an orderly pursuit could be organized.</p>
			<section>My horse was traveling practically unguided as I knew that I had probably less knowledge of the exact location of the trail to the pass than he,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">and thus it happened that he entered a defile which led to the summit of the range and not to the pass which I had hoped would carry me to the valley and to safety.</p>
			<section>It is probable,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">however,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">that to this fact I owe my life and the remarkable experiences and adventures which befell me during the following ten years.</p>
			<section>My first knowledge that I was on the wrong trail came when I heard the yells of the pursuing savages suddenly grow fainter and fainter far off to my left.</section>
			<section>I knew then that they had passed to the left of the jagged rock formation at the edge of the plateau,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">to the right of which my horse had borne me and the body of Powell.</p>
			<section>I drew rein on a little level promontory overlooking the trail below and to my left,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">and saw the party of pursuing savages disappearing around the point of a neighboring peak. </p>
			<section>I knew the Indians would soon discover that they were on the wrong trail and that the search for me would be renewed in the right direction as soon as they located my tracks.</section> 
			<section>I had gone but a short distance further when what seemed to be an excellent trail opened up around the face of a high cliff.</section>
			<section>The trail was level and quite broad and led upward and in the general direction I wished to go.</section>
			<section>The cliff arose for several hundred feet on my right,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">and on my left was an equal and nearly perpendicular drop to the bottom of a rocky ravine.</p>
			<section>I had followed this trail for perhaps a hundred yards when a sharp turn to the right brought me to the mouth of a large cave.</section>
			<section>The opening was about four feet in height and three to four feet wide,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">and at this opening the trail ended.</p>
			<section>It was now morning,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">and,</p>
 					<p class="fragment grow">with the customary lack of dawn which is a startling characteristic of Arizona,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">it had become daylight almost without warning.</p>
			<section>Dismounting,</section> 
					<p class="fragment grow">I laid Powell upon the ground,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">but the most painstaking examination failed to reveal the faintest spark of life.</p>
			<section>I forced water from my canteen between his dead lips,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">bathed his face and rubbed his hands,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">working over him continuously for the better part of an hour in the face of the fact that I knew him to be dead.</p>
			<section>I was very fond of Powell;</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">he was thoroughly a man in every respect;</p>
 					<p class="fragment grow">a polished southern gentleman;</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">a staunch and true friend;</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">and it was with a feeling of the deepest grief that I finally gave up my crude endeavors at resuscitation.</p> 
			<section>Leaving Powell's body where it lay on the ledge I crept into the cave to reconnoiter.</section>
			<section>I found a large chamber,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">possibly a hundred feet in diameter and thirty or forty feet in height;</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">a smooth and well-worn floor,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">and many other evidences that the cave had, at some remote period,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">been inhabited.</p>
			<section>The back of the cave was so lost in dense shadow that I could not distinguish whether there were openings into other apartments or not.</section>
			<section>As I was continuing my examination I commenced to feel a pleasant drowsiness creeping over me which I attributed to the fatigue of my long and strenuous ride,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">and the reaction from the excitement of the fight and the pursuit.</p>
			<section>I felt comparatively safe in my present location as I knew that one man could defend the trail to the cave against an army.</section>
			<section>I soon became so drowsy that I could scarcely resist the strong desire to throw myself on the floor of the cave for a few moments' rest,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">but I knew that this would never do,</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">as it would mean certain death at the hands of my red friends,</p>
 					<p class="fragment grow">who might be upon me at any moment.</p>
			<section>With an effort I started toward the opening of the cave only to reel drunkenly against a side wall,</section>
					<p class="fragment grow">and from there slip prone upon the floor.</p>
