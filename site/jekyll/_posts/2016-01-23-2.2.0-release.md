Happy new year! I'm happy to announce the release of ReactJS.NET 2.2. This is a minor release, and includes a number of changes and fixes since 2.1. These are mainly under-the-hood changes.

 - [#210](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/210) - Add support for specifying class name of the wrapper element. *Thanks to [Jonas Tibbling](http://jovnas.se/)*
 - [#216](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/216) - Upgrade to latest version of JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.
 - [#193](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/193) and [#207](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/207) - Upgrade to Babel 6.
 - [#197](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/197) - Use React from NPM rather than manually bundling it.

Have fun, and as always, please feel free to send feedback or bug reports
[on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET).

â€” Daniel
