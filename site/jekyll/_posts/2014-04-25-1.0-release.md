I'm happy to announce the release of ReactJS.NET 1.0! There have not been many changes since version 0.2, but I've decided to release this version as 1.0 since the API is becoming fairly stable, I'm now using it in production for one of the pages on my personal site, and most importantly, I've met the end goal I set when starting the project — Getting it to run on Linux :)

Changes since 0.2:

 * [Full Linux and Mac OS X (Mono) support](/guides/mono.html) via Google's V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine used by Google Chrome and Node.js. Windows support for V8 is a lower priority but will come soon.
 * ES6 transforms (via jstransform) enabled out of the box, meaning you can use some ES6 features such as [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/arrow_functions), [short object notation](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2013/02/es6-and-object-literal-property-value-shorthand.html) and [classes](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:maximally_minimal_classes) in your JSX files.

Have fun, and as always, please feel free to send feedback or bug reports
[on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET).
