I'm happy to announce the release of ReactJS.NET 1.1! This is a minor release and includes a number of changes and fixes since version 1.1:

 * React version upgraded from 0.10.0 to 0.11.1.
 * Fixed an [access violation exception](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/28) when running in Release mode. *Thanks to [Paul Irwin](https://github.com/paulirwin) for reporting and [jlchmura](https://github.com/jlchmura) for fixing*.
 * Always transform JSX in bundles, even when the very first file doesn't have the `/** @jsx React.DOM */` directive. *Thanks to [Rick Beerendonk](https://github.com/rickbeerendonk)*.
 * [ES6 transforms](/guides/es6.html) are now turned off by default since they can conflict with other ES6 transpilers like Traceur. [Check the documentation](/guides/es6.html) to see how to enable them. *Thanks to [Aleksander Heintz](https://github.com/Alxandr)*.

Have fun, and as always, please feel free to send feedback or bug reports
[on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET).

â€” Daniel
