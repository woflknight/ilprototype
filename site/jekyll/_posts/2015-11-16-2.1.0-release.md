I'm happy to announce the release of ReactJS.NET 2.1! This is a minor release, and includes a number of changes and fixes since 2.0:

 - [#189](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/189) - If errors occur while loading a JS file, don't throw an exception until we actually try to **use** the script. This ensures that a syntax error in a file loaded with `AddScriptWithoutTransform` will not crash IIS.
 - [#186](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/186) - Expose `ReactDOM` just in case it's used in some script.
 - [#182](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/182) - Use SHA1 rather than MD5 for cache hashing so that it can be used in a [FIPS-compliant environment](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/811833). *Thanks to [Ruaidhri Primrose](https://github.com/RPrimrose)*
 - Added [a console sample](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/blob/master/src/React.Sample.ConsoleApp/Program.cs) to show how ReactJS.NET can be used outside of a web context.
 - [#195](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/195) - Add `ReactEnvironment.Current` property as a shortcut to get the current React environment. This replaces the old method of directly using the DI container (`React.AssemblyRegistration.Container.Resolve<IReactEnvironment>()`).

Have fun, and as always, please feel free to send feedback or bug reports
[on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET).
