I'm happy to announce the release of ReactJS.NET 1.4! This release adds support for the beta version of ASP.NET 5, better handling of server-side `console.log` calls, and the V8 JavaScript engine is now included as standard (the MSIE engine is still available for use, though).

Full list of changes:

 * [#47](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/47) and [#94](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/94) — [Support for ASP.NET 5](/getting-started/aspnet5.html). You must be using Visual Studio 2015 CTP6 and ASP.NET 5 Beta 3. Documentation will be added to the site shortly.
 * [#86](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/86) — `console` calls such as `console.log` during server-side rendering will automatically be propagated to the client-side. This can greatly assist in debugging server-side rendering. Nicer debugging tools will come in the future!
 * [#96](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/96) — Bundle V8 support by default, stop relying on MSIE engine as much.
 * [#97](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/97) — Upgrade to JSPool 0.2. This improves the handling of JavaScript engines by recycling them after a number of uses, which ensures memory usage doesn't keep growing over time.
 * [#89](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/89) — Fixed "Object doesn't support property or method 'defineProperty'" with MSIE engine when [using Flow types](/guides/flow.html).
 * [#69](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/69) — Support for OWIN. *Thanks to [Marcin Drobik](https://github.com/mandrek44)*.
 * [#70](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/70) — JsxTransformer exceptions now include whole inner exception. *Thanks to [Marcin Drobik](https://github.com/mandrek44)*.
 * [#84](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/84) — Fixed missing strong name on System.Web.Optimization.React and React.MSBuild.
 * [#67](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/67) — ReactJS.NET website now has a fancy logo. *Thanks [Rick Beerendonk](https://github.com/rickbeerendonk)!*

Have fun, and as always, please feel free to send feedback or bug reports
[on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET).
