title: "ReactJS.NET 0.2 - MSBuild and Linux Support"

I'm happy to announce the release of ReactJS.NET 0.2! This is a minor release
and adds a number of new features:

 * [Precompilation of JSX files via MSBuild](/guides/msbuild.html)
 * [Partial Linux (Mono) support](/guides/mono.html).
   Server-side component rendering is supported, but JSX compilation is not yet
   supported. To use JSX on Mono, you will need to precompile your JSX files
   via MSBuild.
 * Cassette MSBuild support - Bundle and minify your JavaScript before
   deployment to improve performance

Internal technical changes:

 * React core no longer depends on System.Web, for easier use outside of an
   ASP.NET context (eg. in a command-line or OWIN application)
 * JSX transformation split from `IReactEnvironment` into new `IJsxTransformer`
   interface. The previous `IReactEnvironment.LoadJsxFile` and
   `IReactEnvironment.TransformJsx` methods have been marked as obsolete, please
   use `IReactEnvironment.JsxTransformer.TransformJsxFile` instead.

Have fun, and as always, please feel free to send feedback or bug reports
[on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET).

&mdash; Daniel
