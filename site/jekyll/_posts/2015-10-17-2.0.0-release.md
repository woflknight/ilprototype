I'm happy to announce the release of ReactJS.NET 2.0! The major change in this release is the switch from JSXTransformer to [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) for transformation of JavaScript files. JSXTransformer is now deprecated, and Babel supports many more ES6 features than JSXTransformer did (see [the Babel site](http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) for a full list). Additionally, syntax error messages are now more detailed and display the correct file name and line number.

Full list of changes:

 * [#138](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/138) - Use Babel to transform JavaScript files.
 * [#171](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/171) - Updated ASP.NET 5 integration to support Beta 8.
 * [#164](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/164) - Upgraded to React 0.14.
 * By default, only handle `*.jsx` files in ASP.NET 5 and OWIN middleware. You can modify the `Extensions` setting in `BabelFileOptions` to change this behaviour.

Under the hood:

 * [#168](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/168) - Everything relating to JSX transformer has been renamed to Babel (eg. `IJsxTransformer` is now `IBabel`).
 * Renamed `React` assembly to `React.Core`. The NuGet package has been called "React.Core" forever, but the corresponding assembly name didn't match, resulting in confusion.
 * Deprecated `IReactEnvironment.TransformJsxFile` and `IReactEnvironment.TransformJsx` have finally been removed. These methods have been obsolete since ReactJS.NET 0.2.

Have fun, and as always, please feel free to send feedback or bug reports
[on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET).
