I'm happy to announce the release of ReactJS.NET 2.4! The main change in this release is upgrading the ASP.NET 5 (or "ASP.NET Core" as it's now called) integration from RC1 to RC2. Note that currently only the full .NET Framework is supported - .NET Core will **not** be supported until a JavaScript engine such as ClearScript runs on it. To use ReactJS.NET with an ASP.NET Core application, you need to ensure that you are using .NET Framework, by using `net451` rather than `netcoreapp1.0` in your `project.json` file.

Some other minor changes are also included. Changes in this release:

 - [#271](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/271) - Upgrade to ASP.NET Core RC2. *Thanks to [Shiki Byakko](https://github.com/ShikiGami)*.
 - [#254](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/254) - Allow JavaScript engines to be bypassed entirely. *Thanks to [Dustin Masters](https://www.dustinsoftware.com/)*.
 - [#266](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/266) - Allow customisation of file name extension for Babel transpilation. *Thanks to [Andrew Ovens](http://andrewovens.com/)*.
 - [#270](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/270) - Always return JS engine to pool after component render. *Thanks to [Dustin Masters](https://www.dustinsoftware.com/)*.
 - [#253](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/253) - Fix handling of relative paths in OWIN.
 - [#226](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/226) - Serialize props when they're set, rather than every time the component render code is called. This ensures that the props are only serialized once rather than twice.

Have fun, and as always, please feel free to send feedback or bug reports
[on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET).
