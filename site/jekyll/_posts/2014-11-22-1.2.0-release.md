I'm happy to announce the release of ReactJS.NET 1.2! This is a minor release and includes a number of changes and fixes since version 1.1.3:

 * Basic source map support. Source maps will now be available when accessing .jsx files directly. It's not supported for combined/minified files at the moment since none of the common .NET minifiers support source maps. ([#8](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/8))
 * React version upgraded from 0.12.0 to 0.12.1.

Server-side rendering:

 * The HTML tag used as the component's container can now be changed. Previously it was hardcoded to be a `div`. ([#45](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/45))
 * The ID of the container element can now be changed. Previously it was always an auto-generated ID in the format "react1", "react2", etc. ([#50](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/50))
 * New `Html.ReactWithInit` helper method to render both the HTML component and its client-side JavaScript initialisation script. This is useful when rendering self-contained partial views containing React components. *Thanks to BartAdv*. ([#42](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/42))

Under the hood:

 * Allow custom `JsonSerializerSettings` to be provided. *Thanks to BartAdv. ([#43](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/43))
 * Switch various methods from `private` to `protected virtual` so they can be overridden. ([#39](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/39))
 * Use newer React factory syntax for instantiating components. ([#46](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/46))

Have fun, and as always, please feel free to send feedback or bug reports
[on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET).
